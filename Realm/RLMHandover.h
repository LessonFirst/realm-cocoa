 An object which is bound to a thread-specific RLMRealm instance, and so cannot be passed between threads.

 Objects of classes conforming to this protocol can be packaged for transport between threads by calling
 `-[RLMRealm exportThreadHandoverWithObjects:]`. Note that only types defined by Realm can meaningfully conform
 to this protocol, and defining new classes which attempt to conform to it will not make them work with
 `exportThreadHandoverWithObjects`.
